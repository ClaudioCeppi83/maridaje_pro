## Core Features:

- Dish Input: Users can input a dish name and a detailed description of its ingredients, flavors, and cooking methods, along with a category selector (e.g., 'appetizer', 'main course', 'dessert'). Category selection is mandatory; 'other' category triggers a popup for specification. Description is optional but absence will result in a recommendation disclaimer.
- Wine Recommendation: AI generates a wine recommendation, specifying the grape varietal(s), ideal characteristics (e.g., acidity, tannins, sweetness, body), and tasting notes that would complement the dish.
- Wine Descriptor Tool: The AI reasons whether a wine requires attributes such as fruitiness, earthiness, or spice level that enhances the pairing, based on an understanding of flavor complementarity.
- Detailed Wine Profile: Display of the generated ideal wine profile. Provide information on recommended serving temperature, and suitable glassware.
- Description Instructions Pop-up: A button that launches a pop-up with instructions for writing the dish description, according to the established prompt.
